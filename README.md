Steller is a small framework for building composeable sound models in
Javascript using the Web Audio API. It features a `GraphNode` abstraction
that encapsulates dynamic signal flow graphs, `Parameterize` to add 
parameters of various kinds to objects and a `Scheduler` for sequencing
audio events just in time. These classes are all available under the
namespace `org.anclab.steller`.

## GraphNode

Encapsulates a sub-graph between a set of input nodes and a set of output
nodes. The two primary methods it adds are -

*Usage*: `var obj = GraphNode(obj, [in1, in2, ...], [out1, out2, ...])` where
`obj` is an object to turn into a `GraphNode`, `inX` are input nodes and `outY`
are output nodes (either `AudioNode` objects or `GraphNode`s).

- `connect(targetGraphNode, outPinIx, inPinIx)`
- `disconnect(targetGraphNode, outPinIx)`

## Parameterise

Imparts the ability to add dynamic parameters to an object. The Ã¸bjet is given
a `params` field through which these parameters can be added and manipulated.

*Usage*: `var obj = Parameterize(obj);`

- `obj.params.define({name: "param", min: 0, max: 100, value: 50})`
- `obj.params.define({name: "param", min: 0, max: 100, audioParam: anAudioParam})`
- `obj.params.define({name: "param", min: 0, max: 100, getter: function () {...}, setter: function (value) {...}})`
- `obj.params.expose(obj2, "param1", "param2", ...)`
- `obj.params.exposeAs(obj2, "paramName", "newParamName")`
- `obj.params.watch("param", function (value, paramName, object) {...});`
- `obj.params.unwatch("param", aPreviouslyInstalledCallback)`

Ex:

    obj.params.define({name: "griffinStrength", min: 0, max: 100, value: 20});
    obj.griffinStrength.value = 40;
    console.log(obj.griffinStrength.valueOf()); // Prints 40.
    console.log(obj.griffinStrength.value);     // Prints 40.


## SoundModel

A sound model is just a parameterizable graph node.

    function SoundModel(obj, inputs, outputs) {
        return Parameterize(GraphNode(obj, inputs, outputs));
    }

## Scheduler

A just-in-time scheduler for continuous temporal behaviour. It threads a clock
object through sequential events part of a single "track". Multiple `track`s
can be `spawn`ed or `fork`ed in parallel and each can have its own clock
object.  The clock object tracks both absolute time and a rate integrated
pseudo time that can be used for things like tempo changes. The complexity of
the scheduler is proportional to the number of simultaneously running tracks.

*Usage*: `var sh = new Scheduler(audioContext);`

You use the methods of the scheduler object to make specifications or "models" and call
`sh.play(s)` to play a built specification.

- `sh.audioContext` gives the audio context whose time base is used for
  scheduling.
- `sh.perform(model, clock, next)` causes the given model to be performed
  "now".
- `sh.cancel()` cancels all scheduled processes.
- `sh.play(model)` causes the given model to be played now. `play` is a simpler
  wrapper around `perform`.
- `sh.stop` is a model that will cause the track in which it occurs to
  terminate.
- `sh.cont` is a model that is a no-op when encountered in a track.
- `sh.delay(dur, [callback])` will cause the models that follow a `delay` in a
  sequence to occur at a later time.  If a `callback` is specified, it will be
  called like `callback(clock, t1r, t2r, startTime, endTime)` for every "tick"
  of the scheduler until the delay finishes. This is useful to perform timed
  animations.
- `sh.loop(model)` makes a model that will loop the given model forever, thus
  never terminating until a `stop` is encountered.
- `sh.loop_while(flag, model)` makes a model that will loop as long as the
  given `flag.valueOf()` is truthy. Once it becomes falsy, the loop terminates
  and continues on to the action that follows it in a sequence.
- `sh.fork(model1, model2, ..)` causes all the given models to start in
  "parallel" and waits for them to finish before continuing.
- `sh.spawn(model1, model2, ...)` like `fork` causes all the given models to
  start in "parallel", but doesn't wait for them to finish.
- `sh.dynamic(function (clock) { return model; })` makes a "dynamic model" that
  will behave like whatever `model` the given function returns, at the time the
  dynamic model gets to run.
- `sh.track(model1, model2, ...)` makes a sequence for performing the given
  models one after another.
- `sh.trackR(model1, model2, ...)` is nearly identical to `track`, except that
  it is more general and makes reusable continuations. It is less efficient
  than `track`, which ought to satisfy most needs.
- `sh.fire(function (clock) {...})` will cause the given callback to be called
  at the time the model is performed.
- `sh.anim(param, duration, v1, v2)` animates the parameter from value `v1` to
  value `v2` over the given `duration` using linear interpolation.
- `sh.anim(param, duration, function (t) { return value; })` will assign the
  return value of the given function (whose time argument is normalized to
  `[0,1]` range) to the parameter over the given duration.
- `sh.anim(param, duration, v1, v2, function (t1) { return t2; })` will use the
  given interpolation function (domain  = `[0,1]`, range = `[0,1]`) to generate
  parameter value s between `v1` and `v2`.
- `sh.rate(r)` changes the rate of passage of pseudo time through the track in
  which it occurs to the given `r`. `r = 1` means that the virtual time is
  itself in seconds.
